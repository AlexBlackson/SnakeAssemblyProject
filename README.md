# Snake Assembly Project
Group project created for my Assembly Language course that uses MIPS Assembly Language on the MARS Java Program to design the popular video game snake
# Project Role
In the group, I took the lead in designing the overall hierarchy of the functions and their calls. I also wrote the code to all of the extraneous cases, such as the snake encountering the wall, itself, a hole, or any other "unusual" case. Finally, I handled the timing components and the snake growth.
